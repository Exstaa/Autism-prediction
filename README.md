# Autism Prediction with JupyterLab and Python

This repository contains a project that predicts the likelihood of autism using a machine learning model developed in JupyterLab with Python.

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict autism based on various features. The goal is to provide a tool that can assist in early detection and intervention.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need Python and several Python libraries. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Exstaa/Autism-prediction
    cd autism-prediction
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```sh
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```sh
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

## Usage

To use the autism prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Open JupyterLab:
    ```sh
    jupyter lab
    ```

2. Open the notebook file `Predictor.ipynb` and run all cells to train the model and make predictions.

3. You can customize the input data in the notebook to test the model with different datasets.

## Results

The model achieved the following performance:
- Accuracy: 100%
